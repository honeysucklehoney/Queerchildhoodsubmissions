# Queerchildhoodsubmissions
"For a participatory art piece called Queer Childhood, we (Mikaela Kautzky, Kennedi Deck, Jake Kuzyk, and Tanner Pendleton) are hoping to collect as many childhood photos of LGTBQIA+ people in our communities as possible. Our goal is to create an archive of queer people in snowboarding, skateboarding, and beyond through a collection of kid photos."
